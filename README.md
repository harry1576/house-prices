<h1> House Price Prediction </h1>
<p> This is an attempt at using previous housing sale data, to predict house price.
This repository contains preprocessing work - to remove bad data and create additional features.
This data is then used to train an XGB Machine learning algorithm </p>
<h2> Exploratory Data Analysis </h2>
Here are a few finding that were discovered during the EDA stage.

<h2> How does XGB Boost work? </h2>


<h2> Future Plans </h2>
